	/// The three branches of government, a foundational concept in many democratic systems, particularly in the United States, are designed to ensure a separation of powers and prevent any one branch from gaining too much control. These branches, in order, are:
	/// Legislative Branch: This branch is responsible for making laws.In the United States, it is composed of Congress, which is divided into two parts:
	/// 	Senate: Each state is represented by two senators, regardless of population, serving six-year terms.
	/// 	House of Representatives: Members are elected based on the population of each state, serving two-year terms.
	/// Judicial Branch: This branch is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring they are applied fairly. It is headed by the Supreme Court, which consists of nine justices appointed for life.The judicial branch also includes lower federal courts.
	/// Executive Branch: This branch is responsible for enforcing laws. It is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.The President is supported by the Vice President, the Cabinet, and various executive agencies.
	/// These branches operate with a system of checks and balances to ensure that no single branch becomes too powerful.
