The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution protects the right to keep and bear arms. It was ratified on December 15, 1791, along with nine other articles of the Bill of Rights


A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.


clarifies its structure:

"Because a well-regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed."


The Constitution was written in a formal and somewhat archaic style that reflects the language conventions of the time. Legal and political documents from the 18th century often employed a more concise and direct form of expression.
