	///		3) constitutional
	///	in the leading time to revolute, there is a recognized|voted|consented leader who is above the <see cref="regime_.et._constitution._gov.power.separation_.ITripod"/>. each branch is still operated (including voted or appointed) under the constitution, and not subject to the nonlegal rescindal from the interim leader. But the interim leader can by law dictate|coordinate or put weigh on one side of balance to solve a deadlock by law, hence to accelerate the efficiency of governance. The interim leader cannot take any other role in any branches of <see cref="regime_.et._constitution._gov.power.separation_"/>, and interim leader's term can be as long as the law allows, and interim leader cannot have any say in whether the interim leader role is cancelled (in which case the intermi leader would have no any role any more and become an ordinary citizen) nor have any say in who would take the role next. The term and the person for the interim leader role is decided by law, only when in emergency;
