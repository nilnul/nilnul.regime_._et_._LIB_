	/// design:
	///		1) a big cog which is hollow with teeth inward; there are three smaller cogs inside the big cog, the inner cog has teeth outward, engaging the outer cog. each inner cog also engages with each other;
	///		; the problem with this design is that the rotation of the inner three cogs might be dynamically nonaligned,  jamming.
	///		; so we need many smaller (of various size) little cogs inbetween.
