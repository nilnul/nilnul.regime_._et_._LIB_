The principle of a jury trial was first established in the year 1215 in England when King John signed the Magna Carta.

In Indiana, the right to a trial by jury is protected by the Bill of Rights of our state constitution.

Article 1 ยง 13 (a) "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to a public trial, by an impartial jury..."
Article 1 ยง 20 (a) "In all civil cases, the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate [undisturbed]."

	/// <summary>
	/// A jury is a group of people who are sworn to listen to evidence, make decisions, and deliver a verdict on a case. Juries are a key part of the English common law system, which originated in the Middle Ages.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///In the United States, juries serve in both civil and criminal trials. They listen to testimony, review evidence, and apply the law as explained by the judge to reach a decision. In criminal cases, the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. In civil cases, they decide whether the defendant is liable or not liable.
	/// </remarks>
	/// The Jury Selection and Service Act outlines the process for selecting jurors and the requirements that citizens must meet to serve on a federal jury. Most US citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to serve on a federal jury.
