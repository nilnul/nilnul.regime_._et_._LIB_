The Statue of Liberty bears an iconic inscription from the poem "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus on a plaque mounted inside the pedestal. The poem was written in 1883 as part of a fundraising effort to build the statue’s pedestal, and it captures the spirit of welcome and freedom associated with the statue.

Key Lines from the Inscription:
	自由女神碑文写着，

"
	Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!
	"

 欢迎你！ 
 那些疲乏了的和贫困的， 
 挤在一起渴望自由呼吸的大众， 
 那熙熙攘攘的被遗弃了的， 
 可怜的人们
 把这些无家可归的 
 饱受颠沛的人们 
 一起交给我。 
 我高举起自由的灯火!


These lines have become a symbol of America’s tradition of welcoming immigrants and offering hope to those seeking a new life. The Statue of Liberty itself symbolizes freedom, democracy, and the friendship between the United States and France.
