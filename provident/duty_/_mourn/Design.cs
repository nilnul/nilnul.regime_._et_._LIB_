		Gold Star families did not invite President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to Arlington National Cemetery by last week to commemorate the third anniversary of the attack at Abbey Gate in Afghanistan, a White House official and a Harris aide told NBC News, rebutting separate claims made Sunday by GOP Sen.

		 at least media and campaign photography is not allowed because those images may capture mourners and graves that did not give permission to share those images.

		some user: 
My parents are also in ANC and when my sister put flowers on the grave for Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, their birthday and other holidays she takes a picture and sends it to all of us in the family. However the those pictures are not used for any political agenda. The law clearly states you can not take pictures or videos for any political purposes. Again it very clearly stated.
