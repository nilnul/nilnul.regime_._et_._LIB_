	/// 1) news freedom, not controlled by any government, party, organization, enterprise, individual;
	/// 2) anyone can publish a news. But technology must be fully employyed to let others note that there might be false information. A credit score system can be attached to the source.
	/// 3) voting system is developed by market, or anyone who wants to. It must be a distributive system, like git; it's a mechnisms boasting an open Api, and any client and svr can support it. The standard is legalized. eg: each individual can cast a vote in a distributive block chain, which can gurantee the privacy and the authenticness of the voter; hse(he or she) can do so by using even self-developed software like signing it digitally;
	///		, that's we outwit by making the mechanism data, not programing;
